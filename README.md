# Spring Boot Learning Projects

This repository showcases my work while learning **Spring Boot**.  
It contains multiple small applications and examples that demonstrate key concepts of building Java backends with the Spring framework.

##  Highlights
- **REST APIs** — built with `@RestController` and JSON responses  
- **Layered Architecture** — Controller, Service, and Repository classes connected properly  
- **Spring Data JPA** — used for database access  
- **Databases** — worked with in-memory H2 as well as external databases (MySQL/PostgreSQL)  
- **Configuration** — explored application properties and profiles
