# Spring Boot Project

This is a practice project I built while learning Spring Boot.  
It shows how to create a simple REST API using Java and the Spring framework.

## Features
- REST API with endpoints for basic CRUD operations  
- Uses Spring Boot auto-configuration  
- In-memory H2 database for quick testing  
- Organized into Controller, Service, and Repository layers
